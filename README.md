# Human Action Detection using Wearable Sensor Data

## 📑 Project Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning model to detect human actions using sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) from the MHEALTH dataset.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Classify physical activities based on analog sensor data from body-worn devices to assist in health monitoring and fitness tracking.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source**: MHEALTH dataset
- **Subjects**: 10
- **Sensors**: Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
2. Feature Extraction
3. Class Balancing
4. Model Training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
5. Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
6. Visualizations (Signal Trends, Feature Importance)

## 📊 Results
| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score | Recall |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| Random Forest | 92% | 91% | 90% |
| Logistic Regression | 86% | 85% | 84% |
